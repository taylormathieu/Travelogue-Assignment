        <h2>Capri, Italy</h2>
        <p>There is no doubt about the fact that Capri is at the top of many traveler's lists. This was one of my favourite locations in Europe to visit. The weather is impecible and the beaches are stunning. Huge cliffs and jaw-dropping rock formations will have you staring at the scenery in awe. The island is extremely picturesque and will have you feeling like you are living in a fairytale. Don't forget to stop in at one of the quaint restaurants along the beach, the food scene is divine. There are endless sites to see, this little city in the mountains will sweep you off your feet.</p>
